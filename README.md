- 💪 I also enjoy exercising at the gym and playing video games in my free time.
- ✈️ My favorite hobby is definitely traveling—whenever I have the chance, I go explore new places!
- 🌎 I love learning languages. I studied in the United States for a full year, where I improved my English, and I’m originally from Spain.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and C.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can improve my programming skills and learn from others.
